### Hello! My name is Aaron Mobley and I am a Data Scientist/Programmer ðŸ‘‹

## A little about myself

+ I have been going through the Data Science program at Bethel school of Technology this past year. <br>
+ I have a passion for the outdoors and nature as well as fishing and surfing. Data Science is a career I am quickly becoming <br>
+ obsessed with. <br>
+ Communication skills are something that sets me a part from others. I believe that communicating well with colleagues and being able <br>
to speak publicly is a lost art.

Here are a few of the skills I have mastered:

| Rank | MY SKILLS |

|     3| MySQL
|     4| MongoDB
|     5| Tableau
